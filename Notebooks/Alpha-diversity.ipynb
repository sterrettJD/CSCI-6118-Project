    "## What is alpha diversity?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alpha diversity is a measure of the unique species (or taxonomic units) existing within one sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements of alpha diversity can be broken into two categories - richness and evenness. **Richness** is how most people think of diversity, as it describes the number of unique species in a sampling location. **Evenness**, on the other hand is a measure of how evenly the organisms in a community are distributed across the different species.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose sampling location A harbors 10 unique species, and location B harbors 25 unique species. Location B would be considered to have higher richness than sample A.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if each of location A's species had a population of 2 (e.g. 2 foxes, 2 cats, 2 dogs, etc...), but location B was dominated by one species (e.g. 200 foxes, 1 cat, 1 dog, 1 horse, 1 proboscis monkey, 1 thorny dragon, etc...), we could say that location A has higher richness than location B.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this isn't super clear yet, don't worry! There will be more examples as we work through this chapter."
