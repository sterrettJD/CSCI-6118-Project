# An Interactive Educational Resource for the Analysis of Microbial Community Ecology

## Project Pitch

### From Keybase pitch:

Effectively, we would create a Jupyter notebook (or a series of Jupyter notebooks) in Python, 
which contain descriptions of concepts like alpha and beta diversity and PCoA, 
as well as demonstrations of how these are calculated based on simulated data. 
Ideally, we could make a few ways to customize these using point-and-click methods and/or code to see how the outcomes change with differing populations/parameters. 
To make this code accessible to others, I think the easiest route would be to Binder-ize (https://mybinder.org/) the notebooks or 
turn them into a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 
This would allow for others to open the resource and run/modify the code in an online interface with the conda environment already set up for them. 
For an example, feel free to check out Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics ([Jupyter book](https://readiab.org/introduction.html) ; 
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/applied-bioinformatics/iab2/main?urlpath=tree/book/introduction.md)). 
I've seen some folks publishing their code for papers in Binder, so it might be a useful skill to learn for the sake of reproducibility!
