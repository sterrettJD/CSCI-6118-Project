Interactive Microbial Ecology Exploration
=====================
Welcome! This educational resource provides insights into learning about microbial community ecology.

It covers main concepts, such as alpha and beta diversity, differential abundance testing, and limitations imposed by sequencing-based approaches.

Additionally, this resource provides code examples for handling the data, which may be useful for those new to Python or hoping to learn to use relevant packages, such as `SciPy`, `scikit-bio`, and `NetworkX`.

To open each chapter in a manner that allows you to individually execute, modify, and run code blocks, click on the rocket figure at the top to open Binder. It might take a minute for Binder to load, but don't worry! 

``Note:`` This is a work in progress and is published in its current state as a final project, but development will continue.
